/**
 * FOR DEVELOPERS
 *
 * By default we support languages listed in {@link org.ice1000.devkt.ui.DevKtDocumentHandler#languages}.
 * To add your own language support, create an IntelliJ Platform plugin first.
 *
 * Than you may take a look at <a href="https://github.com/covscript/covscript-devkt">The CovScript Plugin</a>,
 * as an example, the codes are very similar to IntelliJ Platform plugin.
 *
 * You may create a project from <a href="https://github.com/devkt-plugins/plugin-template">this template</a>,
 * remember to follow the instructions in its README file.
